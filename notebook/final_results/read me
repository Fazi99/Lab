In pakistan county mask (raster) values are not in series (1,2,3....) some are missing (1,3,4,7....) in Csv file you can see
so we code can read first colum of csv and use that sequence for finding county 

Final out put can be in the form of CSV which contain ID (county), total Flood pixel (value), total EVI, and for each crop type 

(crop type can be seen from png file legend values shows pixel value in Pak_cropclass tiff file)


Thankyou Kuwata san
